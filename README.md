# Yuhao Jia Machine Learning/Data Analysis Portfolio
Welcome to my machine learning & data analysis projects page!

I CARE, UNDERSTAND and HELP the world with data, coding and mapping.



Check my projects on AI/ML prediction, data pipeline, cloud computing, policy analytic and web app!


## Machine Learning

* #### [AnalystGPT: Your data anlysis & visualization assistant](https://anlystgpt.streamlit.app/)

  This is a web app I developed by myself. Using openai GPT llm models, it allows you to upload your data, and write description of what analysis you want to do, and then the app will query the data and draw charts based on your description. Anyone can use it to analyze data just by words!

* #### [Hurricane Damage Detection using Random Forest and CNN](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1m7ji0eLPvw7-_8y0Up8dCOc90WtN7Z8-7mvYgz6bWgY/edit#slide=id.g23f820c846a_0_294)

  I used RF and CNN(AlexNet) model to detect hurricane damaged properties through satellite images, and tuned the CNN model through regularization/hyperparameters tuning/data augmentation/ensemble to reach a "human level" classification accuracy: 0.99(Train), 0.97(Dev), 0.98(Test).
  
  Check the project notebook [here](Hurricane_Damage_Detection)!

* #### [Stock Price Prediction comparing Deep Learning Models (GRU,LSTM,GRU+LSTM)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MeUE9QzKXxKZCmsjAKUgUyLI09PvMtikNY9vMguFn6I/edit?usp=sharing)

  In this project, I processed the data and deployed 4 baseline models: a linear regression model, LSTM, GRU, and a combination of LSTM and GRU. In phase2, I  engineered some new features from the original dataset and finetune the hyper parameters to compare the performance difference.

  Check the project notebook [here](Stock_Prediction)!

* #### [ML Algorithm Notebooks (Linear/Logistic/KNN/DecisionTree/Ensemble(Boost)/PCA/CNN/NLP/ReinforcementLearning)](Machine_Learning_Notebooks)

  Using python, I coded each ML algorithm from scratch and in detail, including all steps (such as gradient descent, converge check, regularization, etc.) 
  
## Policy/Marketing/Spatial Data Analysis
  
* #### [Predicting Parking Demand of SF](https://yuhaochrisj.github.io/yuhao_portofolio/Data_Analysis/Prediction%20Parking%20Demand%20in%20SF.html)
  
  In this project, I developed a “time token” algorithm to estimate the parking occupancy, 
  built a space-time prediction model with a good performance of fit by cross validation (low MAE and MAPE).

* #### [Vegetation Impacts on the Spread of Wildfire in California](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/c959ca191af448b782f95cc6d00860de)
  
  In this MUSA Capstone project, I used a statistical approach to answer whether vegetation contributes to the stoppage of wildfire controlling for weather and topography 
  and which vegetation types have a better ability to stop the spread of wildfire.

* #### [People Based Machine Learning - Housing Subsidy](https://yuhaochrisj.github.io/yuhao_portofolio/Data_Analysis/HousingSubsidy.html)

  The aim of this report is to develop a proactive model for targeting home owners who qualify for a home repair tax credit program.

* #### [House Price Prediction in City of Charlotte](https://yuhaochrisj.github.io/yuhao_portofolio/Data_Analysis/House%20Price%20Prediction%20in%20City%20of%20Charlotte.html)

  The purpose of this project is to develop a home price forecasting model to predict home prices of City of Charlotte. 
  The price of a home is a direct reflection of the value of a property, not only in terms of the living conditions and future development of an individual family.

## Cloud Data Pipeline(ETL)/Web(Mapping) APP
* #### [Data Pipeline for Traffic Risk Prediction in Reading, PA](https://github.com/hazellla/final)

  Using Google Cloud Platform, We built a data pipeline: loading, extracting, querying data and visualizing a car crashes prediction model in a web app. Check the Prediction map [here](https://hazellla.github.io/MUSA509-final/site/index.html).

* #### [Volunteer Assistant in Mathare Slum](https://github.com/miaomiao612/Mathare-Slum-Facilities-App)

  This app is developed for volunteers working in the slum to find their destinations and the shortest way to get there. Check the web app [here](https://miaomiao612.github.io/Mathare-Slum-Facilities-App/).
