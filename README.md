# Yuhao Jia Portofolio
Welcome to my machine learning & data analysis projects page!

I CARE, UNDERSTAND and HELP the world with mapping, coding and data.



Check my projects on data analysis, machine learning and web mapping!


## Policy/Spatial Data Analysis
* [Predicting Parking Demand of SF](https://yuhaochrisj.github.io/yuhao_portofolio/Data_Analysis/Prediction%20Parking%20Demand%20in%20SF.html)
  In this project, I developed a “time token” algorithm to estimate the parking occupancy, built a space-time prediction model with a good performance of fit by cross validation (low MAE and MAPE), and engineered and Explored feature data of price rate, built environment, time and space
* [People Based Machine Learning - Housing Subsidy](https://yuhaochrisj.github.io/yuhao_portofolio/Data_Analysis/HousingSubsidy.html)
* [House Price Prediction in City of Charlotte](https://yuhaochrisj.github.io/yuhao_portofolio/Data_Analysis/House%20Price%20Prediction%20in%20City%20of%20Charlotte.html)
* [Predictive Policing: Sexual Harassment Risk in Chicago](https://yuhaochrisj.github.io/yuhao_portofolio/Data_Analysis/Predictive%20Policing%20Sexual%20Harassment%20Risk%20in%20Chicago.html)
* [Space-Time Prediction of Bike Share Demand for NYC](https://yuhaochrisj.github.io/yuhao_portofolio/Data_Analysis/Space-Time%20Prediction%20of%20Bike%20Share%20Demand%20for%20NYC.html)

## Machine Learning
* [ML Algorithm Notebooks (Linear/Logistic/KNN/DecisionTree/Ensemble/PCA/NeuralNetwork)](Machine_Learning_Notebooks)

## Web Mapping APP
