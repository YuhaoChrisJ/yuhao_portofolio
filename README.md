# Yuhao Jia Portofolio
Welcome to my machine learning & data analysis projects page!

I CARE, UNDERSTAND and HELP the world with mapping, coding and data.



Check my projects on data analysis, machine learning and web mapping!


## Policy/Spatial Data Analysis
* [Predicting Parking Demand of SF](https://yuhaochrisj.github.io/yuhao_portofolio/Data_Analysis/Prediction%20Parking%20Demand%20in%20SF.html)
  
  In this project, I developed a “time token” algorithm to estimate the parking occupancy, 
  built a space-time prediction model with a good performance of fit by cross validation (low MAE and MAPE).
  
* [People Based Machine Learning - Housing Subsidy](https://yuhaochrisj.github.io/yuhao_portofolio/Data_Analysis/HousingSubsidy.html)

  The aim of this report is to develop a proactive model for targeting home owners who qualify for a home repair tax credit program. 

* [House Price Prediction in City of Charlotte](https://yuhaochrisj.github.io/yuhao_portofolio/Data_Analysis/House%20Price%20Prediction%20in%20City%20of%20Charlotte.html)

  The purpose of this project is to develop a home price forecasting model to predict home prices of City of Charlotte. 
  The price of a home is a direct reflection of the value of a property, not only in terms of the living conditions and future development of an individual family.

* [Predictive Policing: Sexual Harassment Risk in Chicago](https://yuhaochrisj.github.io/yuhao_portofolio/Data_Analysis/Predictive%20Policing%20Sexual%20Harassment%20Risk%20in%20Chicago.html)

  In this project, I demonstrated the limitations of prediction model due to the bias in the original dataset,
  selected feature data based on ‘broken window theory’,
  and built poisson regression model on k-fold and neighborhood cross validation

* [Space-Time Prediction of Bike Share Demand for NYC](https://yuhaochrisj.github.io/yuhao_portofolio/Data_Analysis/Space-Time%20Prediction%20of%20Bike%20Share%20Demand%20for%20NYC.html)

  Bike share system need to ‘re-balance’ bicycles across the network.
  In this project,  time-space predictive modeling is used to predict the bike share pattern of each hour in New York City and try to address an operations issue for the citi-bike system provided by lyft.

## Machine Learning
* [ML Algorithm Notebooks (Linear/Logistic/KNN/DecisionTree/Ensemble/PCA/NeuralNetwork)](Machine_Learning_Notebooks)

## Web Mapping APP
* [Volunteer Assistant in Mathare Slum](https://github.com/miaomiao612/Mathare-Slum-Facilities-App)

  This app is developed for volunteers working in the slum to find their destinations and the shortest way to get there.
